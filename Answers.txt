1. The command defined as trymake is ran in the terminal. An executable is outputted to the directory with the name "hellomake".
2a. *I reckon the problem is that it is looking for the *.o files. Investigate. Perhaps not the problem. Will have to ssh into the lab computer to figure out whats going on.
2b. Full command is ran in termina with the CC and CFLAGS variables defined. An exectuable is outputted to the directory with the name "hellomake". There are *.o files present as well, named hellofunc.o and hellomake.o.
3. The output is still "Hello makefiles! 42"
